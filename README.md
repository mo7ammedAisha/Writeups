# 📝 Penetration Testing Write-ups

This folder contains my personal penetration testing write-ups created during my learning journey in offensive security.

Each write-up documents the full methodology used during testing, including:
-  Reconnaissance & Enumeration
-  Vulnerability Identification
-  Exploitation
-  Privilege Escalation (when applicable) 
-  Lessons Learned & Notes

## Structure
Each subfolder usually represents a:
- Vulnerable machine
- Lab
- Challenge
- Platform (e.g. TryHackMe, Hack The Box, custom labs)

Inside each folder you may find:
- `README.md` → main write-up
- Screenshots / proof files
- Commands and payloads used during testing

## Disclaimer
All activities documented here were performed **legally** in controlled lab environments and are intended **for educational purposes only**.

## Goal
The purpose of these write-ups is to:
- Track my progress
- Improve my reporting skills
- Build a professional portfolio for future penetration testing and red team roles
